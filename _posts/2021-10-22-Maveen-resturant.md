**Here are the details**
- Country = Mexico
- Cities under Mexico(4) =  Ciudad Victoria, Cuernavaca, Jiutepec, San Luis Potosi
- Total Consumers = 138
- Total Restaurants = 130

<br/>  

## 1) What type of cuisine is preferred most by consumers?

Here we can see that majority of the consumers preferring Mexican, that is more than 70% of consumers preferring Mexican (97 consumers out of 138 consumers).

And the second-best preferred cuisine is American, but it is preferred by less than 10% (11) consumers.

## 2) What type of cuisine is preferred most by restaurants?

Top 5 cuisine preferred by restaurants

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92777166/138443072-144d2f8a-01c0-461d-b886-1cda46c26fa8.png)


Here we can see Mexican is available only in 28 restaurants out of 130 restaurants, that is just 22% of restaurants (when compared to 70% of consumers prefer Mexican).
Ok, let’s compare consumers preferred cuisine vs restaurants available


**Here we have two points (Investment’s opportunity point view)**
- Are the restaurants sufficient for consumers based on their preferred cuisine?
- Is there any consumer-preferred cuisine not in restaurants?

<br/>

`1) Are the restaurants sufficient for consumers based on their preferred cuisine?`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92777166/138443589-898d19cd-0d64-4608-869e-95c8721b1f6a.png)

Here we can see that restaurant available cuisine vs the number of consumers-preferred that cuisine.

As we can see majority difference is there in Mexican cuisine but if see in percentage

As we can see Mexican is at 4th, and coffee shop is in 1st

Yes, 1 coffee shop is enough for 8 consumers...

It depends, but we don’t have enough information like Restaurant seating capacity, profit margin, working hours, and also the consumer's data, etc. As of now, I am looking at available data.

And fast food, international, bar & brewery these restaurants are more than consumers which preferred those cuisines. we don’t need to invest in this (yeah place and quality of service we can look at, ex: the place where no bar but consumers are there)

<br/>  

`2) Is there any consumer-preferred cuisine not in restaurants?`  
- Total no. of consumer preferred cuisine (Distinct)    = 101 
- no. of cuisine covered(available) in restaurants      = 23
- no. of cuisine unavailable (not there) in restaurants = 78

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92777166/138444835-876892a5-fcc1-44bb-8a63-4f835280907a.png)

<br/>  

There are many (78) untouched cuisines available for to invest, out of which Top 11 cuisine which is preferred by consumers

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92777166/138445207-659fd75e-ab7e-404f-9ec7-d7f8951e0403.png)

<br/>  

*Up to now we only consider consumer-preferred cuisine available or not in the restaurants? And are the restaurants being sufficient or not to cover consumers? But we don’t consider Place(city) (In which city do we have to invest?)*

If we can add place(city) it is more accurate where we have to invest (city)

Let’s start with the easy one, 

<br/>  

## In which places(city) the highest no. of consumer-preferred cuisine not available in restaurants?

Top 7 preferred cuisine by consumers on the basis of the city

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92777166/138445440-7184783e-78aa-42b9-9f7b-968d8ada005c.png)


Here we can see top cuisine based on no. of consumer's preferences, which are not there in restaurants are in San Luis Potosi.
We can easily consider these places to invest by considering other factors

<br/>  

## Are the existing restaurants sufficient for consumer-preferred cuisine in that specific city?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92777166/138445528-30fc58e7-4d7f-43be-a281-ba4fa976ca55.png)

Here is the one cuisine – Mexican.

As we can see there is no Mexican restaurant in Jiutepec and also in San Luis Potosi 60 consumers are preferring Mexican but only 12 restaurants providing Mexican (yeah, it may be sufficient but when compared to Ciudad Victoria City it is less) and they are many factors we can look into it like, the distance between cities, transportation, own vehicles, rating and so on. here I am just limiting to the city factor only.

Upon the Mexican data

**We can consider Invest in a Mexican restaurant in Jiutepec considering other factors.**

*We have to consider other points also when we investing in restaurants like rating, and other consumer factors like parking, transport, alcohol service, budget, occupation, etc.*

`Analysis not completed at,(some factors to be considered for the conclusion) soon update...`
