 ## Maven Restaurant Challenge

Maven Restaurant Challenge, you will be assuming the role of Lead Analyst at a firm that invests in new restaurant opportunities abroad. After conducting a study to learn about the restaurant market in several Mexican cities, you've been asked to analyse interesting patterns and trends in the data to help understand the market and make investment decisions.

Here are the details 
Country = Mexico
Cities under Mexico (4) = Ciudad Victoria, Cuernavaca, Jiutepec, San Luis Potosi
Total Consumers = 138
Total Restaurants = 130

## 1) What type of cuisine is preferred most by consumers?

Top 5 Preferred cuisine by consumers

Here we can see that majority of the consumers preferring Mexican, that is more than 70% consumers preferring Mexican (97 consumers out of 138 consumers).
And the second-best preferred cuisine is American, but it is preferred by less than 10% (11) consumers. 

## 2) What type of cuisine is preferred most by restaurants?
Top 5 cuisine preferred by restaurants
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92777166/137974849-9eb5e6af-3071-443e-a5a8-8633b7ecabcf.png)

Here we can see Mexican is available only in 28 restaurants out of 130 restaurants, that is just 22% of restaurants (when compared to 70% of consumers prefer Mexican).
Ok, let’s compare consumers preferred cuisine vs restaurants available 
Here we have two points (Investment’s opportunity point view)
•	Are the restaurants sufficient for consumers based on their preferred cuisine?
•	Is there any consumer preferred cuisine not in restaurants?




Are the restaurants sufficient for consumers based on their preferred cuisine?
 
Here we can see that restaurant available cuisine vs number of consumer preferred that cuisine.
As we can see majority difference is there in Mexican cuisine but if see in percentage

 
As we can see Mexican is at 4th, and coffee shop is in 1st 
Yes, 1 coffee shop is enough for 8 consumers... 
It depends, but we don’t have enough information like Restaurant seating capacity, profit margin, working hours, and also the consumers data etc. As of now I am looking on available data.
And fast food, international, bar & brewery these restaurants are more than consumers which preferred those cuisine. we don’t need to invest in this (yeah place and quality of service we can look, ex: place where no bar but consumers are there)

Is there any consumer preferred cuisine not in restaurants?
Total no. of consumer preferred cuisine (Distinct)    = 101
no. of cuisine covered(available) in restaurants         = 23
no. of cuisine unavailable (not there) in restaurants = 78







There are many (78) untouched cuisines available for to invest, out of which Top 11 cuisine which are preferred by consumers
 

Up to now we only consider consumer preferred cuisine available or not in the restaurants? And are the restaurants being sufficient or not to cover consumers? But we don’t consider Place(city) (In which city we have to invest?)
	

If we can add place(city) it is more accurate where we have to invest (city)
Let’s start with easy one, 
In which places(city) the highest no. of consumer preferred cuisine not available in restaurants?
Top 7 preferred cuisine by consumers on the basis of city
 
Here we can see top cuisine based on no. of consumers prefer which are not there in restaurants are in San Luis Potosi.
We can easily consider these places to invest by consider other factors 
And other point is
Are the existing restaurants sufficient for consumer preferred cuisine in that specific city?
 


Here is the one cuisine – Mexican.
As we can see there is no Mexican restaurant in jiutepec and also in San Luis Potosi 60 consumers are preferring Mexican but only 12 restaurants providing Mexican (yeah, it may be sufficient but when compared to ciudad Victoria City it is less) and they are many factors we can look into it like distance between cities, transportation, own vehicles, rating and so on. here I am just limiting to city factor only.

Upon the Mexican data
We can consider Invest in Mexican restaurant in Jiutepec considering other factors.


We have to consider other points when we investing in restaurants like rating, and other consumer factors like parking, transport, alcohol service, budget, occupation etc.
