## Requirements `Upwork`

I'm stuck in a project of creating a data analysis of the performance of the products sold in a restaurant.

I have:
1. the selling data base - product, qty sold per day, unit of the restaurant, shift - extracted via SAP Business Objects;
2. the menu data base - which products are currently in the menu in each unit of the restaurant - created by the restaurant unit based on the actual menu;
3. the products data base - which products are registered in the system and respective ids - extracted from the system.
* All these data bases were extracted in .xlsx.

Now I don't know how to proceed, what are the next steps. Looking for someone to clean the data, create simple analysis on Power BI and develop the dashboards to publish to the C-level.
