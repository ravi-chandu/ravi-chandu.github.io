## Linear regression
Linear Regression method helps us to find whether the relationship among X variable(Independent) & Y variable(Dependent) is exists & level of effect.
here 
- Postive relationship (X increase leads to Y increase)
- Negative relationnship (X increase leads to Y decrease)

eg: customers income level vs purchases of products

- R = correlation Cofficient(ranges from -1 to 1),
- R^2 = Coefficient of Determination(ranges from 0 to 1)
