A comprehensive sales analytics solution I built for a mid-size e-commerce company. This project involved:

- Connecting to multiple data sources (SQL Server database, Excel files, API)
- Building a robust data model with proper relationships and hierarchies
- Creating 12+ interactive visualizations and KPI cards
- Implementing advanced DAX calculations for year-over-year comparisons and forecasts
- Deploying to Power BI Premium for real-time updates

**Impact**: Reduced report generation time from 8 hours to 15 minutes, enabling faster decision-making.
